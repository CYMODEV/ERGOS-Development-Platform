# ERGOS-Development-Platform
ERGOS is an open platform that maps skilled workers and underutilized resources into project-ready capacity for local economies.   Built on a resilient ring topology, ERGOS lets communities operate their own autonomous “rings” while selectively connecting with others to share talent, tools, and opportunities.
